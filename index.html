                            My name is Youssou Diop Jr. I was born December 4th 1996, in Bronx, New York. I played
                            baseball much of
                            my childhood in New York, in fact I took place in the Little League World Series.
                            Once I finished middle school my family and I relocated to Waxhaw, North Carolina in
                            2010 in hopes of
                            more peaceful living.</p>

                        <p class="par2">
                            Through high school I never really took technology too seriously.
                            I was always on top of the new iPhones and the latest and greatest tech.. I just never
                            really did much
                            research into it. I was more fond of building drift cars with my long time friend
                            Charles.
                            A few wrecked cars and expensive projects later lead me to a less money hungry hobby
                            which happened to
                            be skateboarding.</p>

                        Skating and video games took up most of my occupation from there on with no clear
                        plan of what was to come next in my life.
                        Up until my father introduced me a little more to his occupation and what all web
                        development and
                        programming was. I started to fancy the though of breaking down and getting to really
                        see what makes
                        what we use on a daily basis tic.
                        Now I am furthering my curiosity of programming at The University of North Carolina In
                        Charlotte...
